# **Kizomba**

The website is for a dance company, a company that organizes dances in different cities around the world. The website will let the users know its purpose and the dates and locations for the upcoming dances. There will also be a galllery of dancers to help arouse interest.

## **UX**

The website is laid out in a way that allows users to navigate with ease. It also provides the kind of information they would expect. The about us page lets the users know what the company does. Made the navigation and the footer similar across pages in order to provide familiariry and uniformity for the users, which enhances their user experience.

### **user stories**:
As a user type, when visiting a website I look at the homepage to give me a brief introduction of what the website is about, in this case the jumbotron and the header at the top lets me know the website is about dancing and the footer also briefly explains what the compnay is about. 

As a user type, I want to jump from one section to a specific section, the navigation bar and the buttons help me with that.

As a user type, i found the color combination appealing and helped distinguish different parts of the website. The footer also provides me with the social media links to further interact with the company.

## **Features**
 
**Home page**: The homepage has a big banner and headers that invite the users in and there is a brief paragraph that introduces the users what the company does.

**About me page**: This page gives users more information about the company and is written in a way to persuade them to sign up to the upcoming festivals. It also contains the box that displays the upcoming festival.

**Festivals page**:
This page displays the date and the location of our upcoming festival for the convenience of our users.

**Gallery**
this page displays a gallery of dancers, giving users a visual of what to expect.

**Alert box**:

the alert box was included to inform users of possible date changes.

**Contact**

the contact form allows users to send us any questions or inquiries they might have.

**Buttons**

The bottons are a great way to direct users from one section to another. It just increases the ease with which users are able to interact with the website.

## **Technologies Used**

**Html and CSS**
the project uses html and css to build and style the website. Thesed two technologies compliment each other.

**Javascript**
Used javascript from bootstrap to add interactivity.

**Bootstrap**
most of my html code was retrieved from bootstrap.

**Inspect/ Toggle device toolbar**
Used these tools to test the responsiveness of the website in different browser sizes like: desktop, mobile, and tablet. And made chnages accordingly to the website to enhance their responsivess and layout.

**Gitpod and replt.it**
Used these two tools to create my codes.

**Github**
Used github to store my data and to host my website.

## **Testing**

**home and About me pages**:

These two pages contain a box that displays the upcoming festivals. If you check desktop, you'll notice that the box and the paragraphs display inline. However on smaller devices (table and mobile), I adjusted the code to display the box on its own, so it appears above the paragraphs. Applied top padding to give some space between the box and the header.

**Contact us**:
this page contains the contact form. It is centered. Try sending the form without entering a valid email format. A box will appear letting you know that it's invalid.
Also all the other fields are required in order to send the form.

## **Deployment**

I have been committing and storing my work on github throughout the development process. 
The project is deployed to github. Github provides us a link to access the project.
